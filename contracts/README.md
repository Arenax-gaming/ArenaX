# 🌟 ArenaX Stellar Smart Contracts

## Overview

The ArenaX contracts workspace contains **Soroban smart contracts** for the ArenaX gaming platform. Currently includes a working example contract and documentation for planned contract implementations.

## Current Implementation

### 📝 Example Contract
A simple demonstration contract showing basic Soroban functionality:
- Contract initialization with admin setup
- Basic storage operations
- Simple greeting function
- Unit tests for all functions

**Location**: `src/example.rs`

## Planned Contract Implementations

## Integration with Backend

The ArenaX backend will integrate with these contracts through the Stellar Rust SDK:

### Contract Interaction Flow

```rust
// 1. Initialize shared utilities and token contracts
let shared_client = ContractClient::new(&stellar_client, &shared_contract_id);
let token_client = ContractClient::new(&stellar_client, &arenax_token_contract_id);

// 2. Create tournament with tournament manager
let tournament_client = ContractClient::new(&stellar_client, &tournament_contract_id);
let tournament_id = tournament_client.call(
    "create_tournament",
    &[admin_address, tournament_config]
).await?;

// 3. Register participants and collect entry fees
tournament_client.call(
    "register_participant",
    &[tournament_id, participant_address, entry_fee]
).await?;

// 4. Create prize pool with prize distribution contract
let prize_client = ContractClient::new(&stellar_client, &prize_contract_id);
prize_client.call(
    "create_prize_pool",
    &[tournament_id, total_entry_fees, participant_count]
).await?;

// 5. Update reputation after match completion
let reputation_client = ContractClient::new(&stellar_client, &reputation_contract_id);
reputation_client.call(
    "update_reputation",
    &[player_address, reputation_change, "match_won"]
).await?;

// 6. Distribute prizes to winners
prize_client.call(
    "distribute_prizes",
    &[tournament_id, winners_list, prize_amounts]
).await?;
```

### Cross-Contract Communication

The contracts are designed to work together:
- **Tournament Manager** coordinates tournament lifecycle
- **Prize Distribution** manages prize pools and payouts
- **Reputation** tracks player fairness and skill
- **ArenaX Token** handles in-platform rewards and payments
- **Shared Utilities** provides common functionality across all contracts

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Admin-only functions for critical operations
- Player-specific functions with proper authorization
- Role-based access control for contract functions

### Audit Trail
- All contract operations are logged on-chain
- Immutable transaction history
- Transparent operations

## Gas Optimization

### Efficient Storage
- Optimize data structures for minimal storage costs
- Use packed data types where possible
- Implement efficient data access patterns

### Batch Operations
- Group multiple operations in single transactions
- Minimize contract calls for better performance
- Optimize for Stellar network fees

## Contributing

### Development Guidelines
1. Follow Rust best practices
2. Write comprehensive tests
3. Document all public functions
4. Ensure security best practices
5. Optimize for gas efficiency

### Adding New Contracts
1. Create new module in `src/`
2. Add module to `lib.rs`
3. Write comprehensive tests
4. Update this README
5. Follow the example contract pattern
